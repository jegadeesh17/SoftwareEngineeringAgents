## Token discipline

Everything you read stays in your context and is re-sent on every later turn, so read only what this job needs.

1. **Living docs.** For `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/SPEC.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/TASKS.json` and `docs/CODEBASE_MAP.md`, list the headings first (`grep -n '^#' <file>`; in `docs/TASKS.json`, search for your task id). Then read only the sections named in your task's `context` list or your delegation message, by line range. Never read a living doc whole when it is over 300 lines.
2. **QA results.** Never read `docs/QA_RESULTS.json` whole. Print only the entries you need: `python -c "import json;print([e for e in json.load(open('docs/QA_RESULTS.json',encoding='utf-8')) if e['task_id'].startswith('<ID>')][-3:])"`.
3. **Source files.** Search for the symbol, then read about 200 lines around it. Never print a whole file over 300 lines.
4. **Searches.** Keep search output under 50 lines (`| head -50`), or list matching files only.
5. **No re-reads.** Do not read a file again unless it changed since you read it.
6. **Commands.** Use quiet or summary reporters. When output may exceed 60 lines, redirect it to a log file in the system temp folder and show only the exit code and the last 60 lines.
7. **Images and PDFs.** Do not open them unless your job is about them.
8. **Return.** Keep your report short: file paths and results, one line per finding, no pasted code or full logs. Your files are the hand-off.
9. **Verification first.** These rules never override verification: when correctness needs more context, read it and say why in your report.
